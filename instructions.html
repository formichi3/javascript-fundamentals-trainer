<p>These exercises are designed to ensure your preparedness for your upcoming course with Galvanize, "Intro to Building Web Apps Using React."</p>

<h2 id="completingtheexercises">Completing the exercises</h2>

<p>The first thing you'll need to do is create an account with CodeSandbox. You can sign in with GitHub.</p>
<p>The second thing you'll need to do is <strong>fork</strong> this project into your own account.</p>
<p>Now you're ready to start the exercises.</p>
<p>There are 18 exercises in <code>./src/index.js</code>. For some of them, you may need to fill
out a stubbed function that is already named and exported (Note that arrow functions 
and traditional function declarations are used interchangably, at random, intentionally).
For others, you may need to write code from scratch, possibly in the global scope. For 
still others, you may need to write a short answer in prose. Read all the instructions 
for each exercise carefully.</p>

<p>Most of the exercises have automated tests that correspond to them in 
<code>./src/index.test.js</code>. Feel free to read these tests if you seek a sharper understanding
of expected behavior. Other exercises, because they concern syntax/implementation more 
than behavior, or because they require a written response in prose, will be manually
reviewed by Galvanize instruction staff. </p>

<p>Lastly, please note that any reference to "the page" or to an "element on the page" is a reference 
	to the <code>index.html</code> file which will render any page updates you make with JavaScript. 
	It does not refer to the <code>instructions.html</code> file which contains these instructions. 
	Click the link at the top of this page, or click the refresh button in this mini-browser,
	to get back to the rendered version of <code>index.html</code>.

<h2>Submitting your exercises</h2>

<p>Use the link to your forked version of the project to submit your completed work to Galvanize. You'll receive a submission
	deadline and a means of submission (Slack channel, etc.) shortly if you haven't already.</p>

<h2 id="studying">Resources</h2>

<p>You may feel that you are already proficient in modern JavaScript and you do not need
to additional resources in completing these exercises. That's great! You can go through 
all the exercises, see how you do, and from there determine how much further studying you need. </p>

<p>For those who need skilling up, here are some great starting points that we recommend, both of which come from LinkedIn Learning:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>JavaScript Essential Training: https://www.lynda.com/JavaScript-tutorials/JavaScript-Essential-Training/574716-2.html</p></li>
<li><p>Learning ECMAScript 6: https://www.linkedin.com/learning/learning-ecmascript-6</p></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="gettinghelpandfeedback">Getting help and feedback</h2>

<p>As you work through the exercises, or as you explore online resources, we recommend
that you write down any questions that may arise. Post those questions to the Slack channel on Autodesk Main for this training — priv-react-201903 — remembering to add them to the pinned post created for this purpose. Your Galvanize instructor
will aggregate those questions and address them in a dedicated Q&A Zoom session in the week before the training (invitation
to follow). During the Q&A session, the instructor will provide a teacher's edition of these exercises for further study. 
Our goal is to ensure that everyone is fully prepared to get the most out of this 4-day training. </p>
